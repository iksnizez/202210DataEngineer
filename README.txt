DATA ENGINEERING PROJECT- JOHN BRZEZINSKI

The juypter notebook can be run in its entirity to scrape general data about La Liga teams 
and their players. It scrapes:
		Team Name, web ID, Foreign player count market value 
		Player Name, Team Name, Age, Position, market Value

The scraped data is then passed into an in-memory database to illustrate table creatation, 
population, and data storage. 


*** The players data scrape has execution pauses in it to avoid overloading their server. 
The delay from this section is from the pauses and will take about 200 seconds to
complete with the 10second pause currently in the code.
